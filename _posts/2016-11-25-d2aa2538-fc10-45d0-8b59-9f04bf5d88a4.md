'Cells' screenprint was made using the 'reduction' technique, also known as the suicide technique. It is sometimes called suicide printing since if you make a mistake in the later stages, there is nothing you can do about it because you can't redo the earlier stages.

A single mesh is used and first print is the entire image. Areas of the screen are then blocked with a filler and the second colour printed. The sequence is repeated and at each pass the printed area is reduced until the final result is achieved. This method requires very careful registration.
